# Winter DayZ Console...Sort of

(as sen in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6ZGxCv7_k)

Above are the json files to cover the DayZ map, either Chernarus or Livonia, with a decal that makes it look like it has snowed.
There are 2 types of decals used. One is a crosswalk decal and the other is a runway line 6x30 decal. They are scaled up and give the look of snow. 
In each directory will be the objectspawnerarr data to call the files from the custom folder.

# Donations
I've been asked by a few people how to donate to me.

I donâ€™t  really like promoting that sort of thing, but here are a couple of ways to do so if you wish to.
Costs will go towards DayZ server costs and general content creation/streaming.

Thank you!
